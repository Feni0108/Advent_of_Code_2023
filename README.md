### Advent of Code 2023

This year I would like to make solutions for all of the Advent of Code exercises. In my opinion it is a very nice challenge to code every day. 

I created a Java project in IntelliJ and I am going to put the solutions for every day in a different package. You just have to download the whole project, open it in the editor, end run it.
